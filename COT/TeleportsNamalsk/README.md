# Teleportation coordinates for Namalsk

## Note

Some locations are missing, main locations are specified but many others can be added (feel free to make a Pull Request!)
Some locations are bugged out at the moment (they're marked as `(bugged)`), avoid using them unless you can TP/Noclip out if you're stuck!

## Install

1. Shutdown the server (otherwise the configuration will be overwritten by the inmemory config)
2. Replace the `Teleports.json` file at the following location `<SERVER_ROOT_FOLDER>\<PROFILES_FOLDER>\CommunityOnlineTools\`
3. Start your server and enjoy the new teleport points
